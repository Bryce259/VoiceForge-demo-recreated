# VoiceForge-demo-recreated
This is a remake of the VoiceForge demo webpage. VoiceForge is a text -to-speech compiny powered buy Cepstral. However, the VoiceForge demo is pritty sloppy. The maximym limet of carecturs to type is 120. This new html file fixes that, and lets you type as mutch as you need. However their is a problem with playbac of audio in the HTML file.
