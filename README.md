    # VoiceForge-demo-recreated
This is a remake of the VoiceForge demo webpage. VoiceForge is a text -to-speech compiny powered buy Cepstral. However, the VoiceForge demo is pritty sloppy. The maximym limet of carecturs to type is 120. This new html file fixes that, and lets you type as mutch as you need. However their is a problem with playbac of audio in the HTML file..
If you go to the demo webpage, people may say that VoiceForge is broken. The truth is that in the site settings (if you have one ), you can turn on allow unsecured content. This is mabie because it is still requesting http version of JQuery. VoiceForege used to be not secure because it had http in the URL, and now has https, so they are now secure. The requesting of http version of JQuery may be why audio won't play on the website. The file Fix VoiceForge user.js should do the trick.
If you have comments, or problems or feedback please leve them.
